General TODO:

- code Internet class (checks connection and actual time):
  * implement getting UTC time - get http header and parse "Date: " parameter
  * find out why CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION doesn't mute output to stdout
  
- code OAuth2 class:
  * Refactorization?: making request move to new method
  * Refactorization: use Internet class for making requests

- code TaskSynchronizer class:
  * implement callbacks (information about update - failed or done)
  
- code plugin for Google Tasks:
  * inherit TaskSynchronizer class:
    + implement methods
- consider how to give read and write access to TaskSerializer and
  TaskSynchronizer derived classes (in plugin)
  
- Refactorization:
  * leave standard serialization in AppEngine and let plugins serialize
    only user data (extract adequate code to AppEngine and PluginEngine)
  * make Task* classes code cleaner (frienship declarations) and extract
    task synchronization to adequate AppEngine class, plugins should
    communicate via this class (get directly needed data)
  * checkout OAuth2 class (in TODO)
  * make cache for time as RFC3339 timestamp and extract converting methods
